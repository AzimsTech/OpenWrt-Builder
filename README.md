# OpenWrt-Builder

The OpenWrt-Builder workflow, running on GitHub Actions, first retrieves the `.overview.json` file from the OpenWrt downloads server [https://downloads.openwrt.org](https://downloads.openwrt.org). It then parses this structured data to dynamically determine the target PROFILE, which configures the Image Builder's build process within the GitHub Actions environment.
